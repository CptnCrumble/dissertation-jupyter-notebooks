# dissertation-jupyter-notebooks
Repository for jupyter notebooks used in my dissertation.  
Models are designed to be run against data that is not stored in the repository for privacy reasons.

## Running the notebooks
Built inside a docker container, if you have docker installed then simply run the __run_notebook_docker.sh__ script and follow thw URL returned by your terminal. Not tested against natively run jupyter-notebook/ipynb but should work fine.
